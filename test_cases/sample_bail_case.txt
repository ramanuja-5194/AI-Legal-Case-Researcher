CASE DETAILS

Petitioner: Rajesh Kumar
Respondent: State of Maharashtra

FACTS:
On 15th January 2024, the petitioner Rajesh Kumar was arrested by the police in Mumbai 
on allegations of theft under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code. The complainant, 
Mr. Suresh Sharma, alleged that on 10th January 2024, his laptop worth Rs. 50,000 
was stolen from his office premises, and based on CCTV footage, the petitioner was 
identified as the person who took the laptop.

The petitioner denies the allegations and states that he was not present at the 
location on the said date. He claims that he was at his home, which is located 
approximately 20 kilometers away from the scene of the alleged theft. The petitioner 
has filed this petition seeking bail, arguing that:

1. There is no direct evidence linking him to the theft
2. The identification based on CCTV footage is unclear and disputed
3. He has strong ties to the community and is not a flight risk
4. He is willing to cooperate with the investigation

The police oppose the bail application, stating that:
1. The CCTV footage clearly shows the petitioner
2. The petitioner has a previous conviction for a similar offense in 2018
3. There is a risk that the petitioner may tamper with evidence or influence witnesses

LEGAL ISSUES:
1. Whether the petitioner is entitled to bail in the present case?
2. What are the relevant provisions of law governing bail in theft cases?
3. What factors should the court consider while deciding the bail application?

CASE TYPE: Criminal

STATUTES MENTIONED:
